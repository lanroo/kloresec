## AWS Security Fundamentals

Understanding AWS security requires knowledge of various services and their security models. Common misconfigurations can lead to serious security breaches.

### Key Security Concepts

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Security Groups and NACLs
- AWS KMS and encryption
- CloudTrail logging and monitoring

## Testing Methodology

### 1. IAM Privilege Escalation

```python
import boto3

def check_iam_privileges(session):
    iam = session.client('iam')
    try:
        response = iam.get_user()
        print(f"Current user: {response['User']['UserName']}")

        # List attached policies
        policies = iam.list_attached_user_policies(
            UserName=response['User']['UserName']
        )
        print("Attached policies:", policies)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 2. S3 Bucket Enumeration

```bash
# List all buckets
aws s3 ls

# Check bucket permissions
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket target-bucket

# List bucket contents
aws s3 ls s3://target-bucket --recursive
```

### 3. Lambda Function Analysis

- Review function permissions
- Check environment variables
- Analyze runtime configurations
- Test function triggers

### 4. Network Security Groups

- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Security group rule analysis
- VPC configuration review

## Best Practices

### 1. Access Control

- Implement least privilege principle
- Regular IAM audits
- Use AWS Organizations
- Enable MFA

### 2. Monitoring

- Enable CloudTrail
- Configure CloudWatch alerts
- Use AWS Config
- Implement GuardDuty

### 3. Network Security

- Proper VPC segmentation
- Security group hardening
- WAF implementation
- DDoS protection

## Common Attack Vectors

1. Misconfigured S3 Buckets

   - Public access
   - Weak permissions
   - Versioning disabled

2. IAM Misconfigurations

   - Overly permissive policies
   - Unused credentials
   - Weak password policies

3. Exposed Services
   - Public RDS instances
   - Open security groups
   - Unprotected APIs

## Mitigation Strategies

1. Regular Security Assessments

   - Automated scanning
   - Manual testing
   - Configuration reviews

2. Security Automation

   - AWS Config Rules
   - Lambda functions for enforcement
   - Automated remediation

3. Incident Response
   - Response plans
   - Recovery procedures
   - Documentation

## Conclusion

AWS penetration testing requires a thorough understanding of cloud services and security controls. Regular assessments and proper security configurations are essential for maintaining a secure cloud environment.
