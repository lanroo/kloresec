## Understanding XSS

Cross-Site Scripting remains one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. XSS occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and other serious security issues.

## Types of XSS

### Reflected XSS

- Malicious script is reflected off the web server
- Typically delivered through URLs
- Requires user interaction to execute

### Stored XSS

- Malicious script is stored on the target servers
- Executes whenever the stored data is retrieved
- Most dangerous type of XSS

### DOM-based XSS

- Occurs in the Document Object Model
- JavaScript execution happens on the client-side
- Can be harder to detect than traditional XSS

## Prevention Techniques

1. Input Validation

   - Validate all user input
   - Use whitelisting approach
   - Implement proper encoding

2. Output Encoding

   - HTML encode dynamic content
   - Use context-specific encoding
   - Implement CSP headers

3. Security Headers
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - X-Content-Type-Options

## Real-world Examples

Recent examples of XSS vulnerabilities found in major applications:

1. Social Media Platforms

   - Profile page XSS
   - Comment section injection
   - Message content exploitation

2. E-commerce Sites
   - Search result reflection
   - Product review injection
   - Shopping cart manipulation

## Code Examples

```javascript
// Vulnerable code
function displayUserInput(input) {
  document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = input;
}

// Secure code
function displayUserInput(input) {
  const encoded = encodeHTMLEntities(input);
  document.getElementById("output").textContent = encoded;
}
```
